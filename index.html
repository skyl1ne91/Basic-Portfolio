                Hi their, my name is carlos and I like to explore, I also like to get lost,
                Well... sometimes, it really depends where, but I also like to learn, it makes me 
                feel like I am progressing, even if sometimes it can be a bit fustrating, but persistence
                is key to overcome any situation. I can say a lot of things about me... but then I dont 
                want  people to get the idea that I am narcisist, I can assume that typing this you may learn
                a few things about me. But why not get to know each other the old fashion way, I am not saying
                I am old fashion, but I feel like one can convey sarcasm and tone when they are talking right infront of
                one another.
